  - UUID constants matching ESP32 code:
    - `SERVICE_UUID = "4fafc201-1fb5-459e-8fcc-c5c9c331914b"`
    - `CHARACTERISTIC_UUID = "beb5483e-36e1-4688-b7f5-ea07361b26a8"`
  - Stream controllers for connection state and shot data
  - Automatic service discovery and characteristic subscription
  - Real-time sensor data parsing and shot detection
  - Session management for shot tracking

### **3. Device Scanning & Connection**
- ‚úÖ **Implemented `scanForDevice()` method**:
  - Scans for "Smart Bat" devices
  - Filters by service UUID
  - 10-second timeout with real-time results
- ‚úÖ **Implemented `connectToDevice()` method**:
  - Automatic service discovery
  - Characteristic subscription for notifications
  - Connection state monitoring
  - Error handling and reconnection logic

### **4. User Interface Integration**
- ‚úÖ **Created `DeviceScanScreen`** (`lib/src/features/connection/device_scan_screen.dart`):
  - Real-time device scanning with progress indicator
  - Device list with connection buttons
  - Connection status display
  - Error handling and user feedback
  - Navigation to dashboard on successful connection

- ‚úÖ **Updated `DashboardScreen`**:
  - BLE connection status widget
  - "Connect to Bat" button
  - Real-time connection state display
  - Visual indicators (green/orange/red)

### **5. Live Session Integration**
- ‚úÖ **Updated `LiveSessionScreen`**:
  - Replaced simulator with real BLE data stream
  - BLE connection status overlay
  - Connection error handling
  - Quick connect button for disconnected state
  - Session management integration

### **6. Provider Integration**
- ‚úÖ **Updated `providers.dart`**:
  - Added `bleServiceProvider` for service management
  - Added `bleShotStreamProvider` for shot data
  - Added `bleConnectionProvider` for connection state
  - Added `bleScanProvider` for device scanning
  - Proper resource disposal and lifecycle management

## üîß **Technical Implementation Details**

### **BLE Service Architecture**
```dart
class BLEService {
  // UUID constants from ESP32
  static const String SERVICE_UUID = "4fafc201-1fb5-459e-8fcc-c5c9c331914b";
  static const String CHARACTERISTIC_UUID = "beb5483e-36e1-4688-b7f5-ea07361b26a8";
  
  // Stream controllers for real-time data
  StreamController<bool> _connectionController;
  StreamController<ShotModel> _shotController;
  StreamController<List<BluetoothDevice>> _scanController;
}
```

### **Data Flow**
1. **ESP32** sends sensor data: `"accX,accY,accZ,gyroX,gyroY,gyroZ"`
2. **BLEService** parses data and detects shots using thresholds
3. **ShotModel** created with calculated metrics (speed, power, timing, sweet spot)
4. **UI** receives real-time updates via Riverpod streams
5. **Firestore** stores shot data for analytics

### **Shot Detection Algorithm**
- **Acceleration Threshold**: 15.0 m/s¬≤
- **Gyroscope Threshold**: 200.0 degrees/s
- **Real-time Processing**: 20Hz sampling rate
- **Metrics Calculation**: Same logic as simulator for consistency

## üì± **User Experience**

### **Connection Flow**
1. User taps "Connect to Bat" on dashboard
2. App scans for Smart Bat devices
3. User selects and connects to their device
4. Real-time connection status displayed
5. Shot data flows automatically during sessions

### **Session Flow**
1. User starts new session
2. BLE service automatically starts if connected
3. Real-time shot detection and display
4. Camera recording synchronized with shots
5. Session data saved to Firestore

### **Error Handling**
- Bluetooth permission requests
- Connection timeout handling
- Device disconnection recovery
- User-friendly error messages
- Fallback to simulator if needed

## üöÄ **Ready for Testing**

### **Hardware Requirements**
- ESP32 with BNO055 sensor
- Bluetooth Low Energy enabled
- Service UUID: `4fafc201-1fb5-459e-8fcc-c5c9c331914b`
- Characteristic UUID: `beb5483e-36e1-4688-b7f5-ea07361b26a8`
- Device name: "Smart Bat"

### **Testing Steps**
1. **Build and install** the Flutter app
2. **Enable Bluetooth** on device
3. **Power on** Smart Bat hardware
4. **Navigate** to dashboard and tap "Connect to Bat"
5. **Scan and connect** to Smart Bat device
6. **Start session** and take cricket shots
7. **Verify** real-time data display

### **Expected Behavior**
- Device appears in scan results
- Connection establishes successfully
- Shot data flows in real-time
- UI updates with latest shot metrics
- Session data saves to Firestore

## üîÑ **Fallback Strategy**

The app maintains compatibility with the hardware simulator:
- **BLE Service**: Primary data source when connected
- **Hardware Simulator**: Fallback for testing/development
- **Seamless Switching**: Automatic detection of data source
- **Consistent UI**: Same interface regardless of data source

---

## üìä **Performance Optimizations**

- **Efficient Scanning**: Service UUID filtering
- **Stream Management**: Proper disposal and cleanup
- **Memory Management**: Automatic resource cleanup
- **Battery Optimization**: Minimal BLE operations
- **Real-time Processing**: 20Hz sensor data handling

## üéØ **Next Steps**

1. **Test with Real Hardware**: Verify ESP32 integration
2. **Fine-tune Thresholds**: Adjust shot detection sensitivity
3. **Add Calibration**: Device-specific calibration options
4. **Enhance Analytics**: Advanced shot pattern analysis
5. **Multi-device Support**: Connect multiple bats
