## Security Rules

Make sure your Firestore security rules allow the required queries:

```javascript
rules_version = '2';
service cloud.firestore {
  match /databases/{database}/documents {
    // Users can read/write their own data
    match /users/{userId} {
      allow read, write: if request.auth != null && request.auth.uid == userId;
    }
    
    // Sessions are accessible by the player who created them
    match /sessions/{sessionId} {
      allow read, write: if request.auth != null && 
        resource.data.playerId == request.auth.uid;
    }
    
    // Shots are accessible by the player who created them
    match /shots/{shotId} {
      allow read, write: if request.auth != null && 
        resource.data.sessionId in get(/databases/$(database)/documents/sessions/$(resource.data.sessionId)).data.playerId == request.auth.uid;
    }
    
    // Player profiles
    match /playerProfiles/{playerId} {
      allow read, write: if request.auth != null && 
        (request.auth.uid == playerId || 
         resource.data.coachId == request.auth.uid);
    }
    
    // Coach profiles
    match /coachProfiles/{coachId} {
      allow read, write: if request.auth != null && request.auth.uid == coachId;
    }
    
    // Coach invite codes
    match /coachInviteCodes/{code} {
      allow read: if request.auth != null;
      allow write: if request.auth != null;
    }
  }
